jsstuffs
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gheja/jsstuffs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gheja/jsstuffs)

Note: the project is not in node.js/npm package compatible format
(yet?), only the minimal package.json config is set up to run mocha
(i.e. has no meaningful "main" and "version" parameters).
